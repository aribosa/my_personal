## Introduction

{{< figure src="/images/profile.jpeg" title="" width=240 class=rounded >}}

Hello! My name is Ariel Bosano, I'm an Industrial Engineer, Data Scientist and frustrated Software Engineer.


I'm currently working as Senior Data Scientist at Clip [clip.mx](https://clip.mx). I’m passionate about data, technology, and how they can be used to improve people’s lives.

The purpose of this blog is to share my thoughts, ideas, projects, and experiences that I’ve encountered in my career. I hope you find it useful and interesting.

Every visitor is welcome to leave a comment, share their thoughts, or just say hi. I’m always open to new ideas and feedback.

This site is <b>under construction</b> and its an ongoing project, basically I'm trying
to learn this <b>Hugo framework</b> and how to deploy it on GitHub Pages. Hope you like it!

I would give my Python skills a :star::star::star::star:.
```python {linenos=table}
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

<!-- New line -->

For Go, I would give myself a :star::star: rating. I had some experience writin
backend code to build marchine learning services.
```go {linenos=table}
func helloWorld() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
```

During my master degree, I used R for data analysis, visualization and simulations.
Honestly, I'm not a big fan of R, but I would give myself a :star::star::star: rating.
```r {linenos=table}
hello_world <- function() {
    print("Hello, world!")
}
```
