## Introduction

Hello! My name is Ariel Bosano, I'm an Industrial Engineer, data scientist and frustrated Software Engineer. I'm currently working as Senior Data Scientist at Clip [clip.mx](https://clip.mx). I'm passionate about data, technology and how they can be used to improve people's lives.

The purpose of this blog is to share my thoughts, ideas, projects and experiencies that I've been through in my career. I hope you find it useful and interesting.

Every visitor is welcome to leave a comment, share their thoughts or just say hi. I'm always open to new ideas and feedback.

> Possitive feedback is always welcome, but negative feedback is even more valuable.
